\title{Run study design workflow}
\usage{
md_run(design, seeds = NULL, trace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{movedesign} (and
\code{movedesign_input}), as returned by \code{\link[=md_prepare]{md_prepare()}}, containing
all study design parameters and data.}

\item{seeds}{List of set seeds to ensure reproducibility (optional);
only needed if replicating from Shiny app into R console.}

\item{trace}{Logical. If TRUE (default), print progress and timing
messages to the console.}
}
\value{
An updated \code{movedesign} object (subclass
\code{movedesign_preprocess}) containing all simulation and outputs
components:
\itemize{
\item \code{simList}: List of simulated telemetry datasets,
one per individual.
\item \code{seedList}: List of random seeds used for
reproducibility.
\item \code{simfitList}: List of fitted movement models for
each simulation.
\item \code{akdeList}: List of home range (AKDE) estimates,
present if the \code{hr} target was listed in \code{set_target}.
\item \code{ctsdList}: List of continuous-time speed and
distance (CTSD) estimates, present if the \code{ctsd} target
was listed in \code{set_target}.
}
}
\description{
Executes a complete simulation and analysis workflow for an animal
movement study design prepared using \code{\link[=md_prepare]{md_prepare()}}. This function
simulates telemetry data, fits movement models, estimates home ranges
and/or movement speeds, and stores all results in the returned object.
Progress and timing messages are printed by default.
}
\details{
This function ensures reproducibility by saving all random seeds and
intermediate results. Progress and timing messages help track the
simulation workflow.

Typical workflow:
\itemize{
\item Prepare a study design with \code{\link[=md_prepare]{md_prepare()}}.
\item Run all simulations and analyses with \code{\link[=md_run]{md_run()}}.
\item Summarize or plot outputs from the returned object.
