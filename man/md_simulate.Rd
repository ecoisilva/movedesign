\title{Simulate movement data from species-level parameters}
\usage{
md_simulate(
  n_individuals = NULL,
  tau_p,
  tau_v,
  sigma,
  dur = NULL,
  dti = NULL,
  set_target = c("hr", "ctsd"),
  which_meta = "mean",
  grouped = FALSE,
  seed = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_individuals}{Integer. Number of tracked individuals (tags)
in the simulated study. This defines the target population-level
sample size used in downstream inference.}

\item{tau_p}{Position autocorrelation timescale(s). Either a single
list with elements \code{value} and \code{unit}, or (when \code{grouped = TRUE})
a named list of such lists, one per group.}

\item{tau_v}{Velocity autocorrelation timescale(s). Same structure
as \code{tau_p}.}

\item{sigma}{Location variance parameter(s). Either a single
list with elements \code{value} and \code{unit}, or (when \code{grouped = TRUE})
a named list of such lists, one per group.}

\item{dur}{A list with elements \code{value} and \code{unit}
specifying the study duration (e.g.
\code{list(value = 2, unit = "months")}). Valid units are
\code{second}, \code{minute}, \code{hour}, \code{day}, \code{month}, or \code{year}.}

\item{dti}{A list with elements \code{value} and \code{unit}
specifying the intended sampling interval between relocations
(e.g. \code{list(value = 1, unit = "day")}). Valid units are the
same as for \code{dur}.}

\item{set_target}{Character vector specifying which target metrics
are evaluated in the study design workflow. Must include one or
both of \code{hr} (home range estimation) and \code{ctsd}
(continuous-time speed and distance).}

\item{which_meta}{Character specifying the population-level
analytical target. Use \code{mean} (default) to evaluate
population means, \code{ratio} to compare group means
(requires \code{grouped = TRUE}), or \code{NULL} for
single-individual inference.}

\item{grouped}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, movement parameters
(\code{tau_p}, \code{tau_v}, \code{sigma}) must be provided as
single lists. If \code{TRUE}, each must be a named list of
group-specific parameter lists, and \code{n_individuals} must be
even.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Random seed used for simulation.
If \code{NULL}, a seed is generated internally.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. Passed to downstream fitting routines.
Currently reserved for future parallelization.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{movedesign_input} containing simulated
tracking data, fitted movement models, and all metadata required
for downstream study design evaluation.
}
\description{
Simulates continuous-time movement trajectories based on
ad hoc movement parameters. The function is designed to support
study design workflows by generating synthetic tracking data under
specified movement, sampling, and analytical assumptions.

Movement parameters can be specified globally (single group)
or for two groups (e.g. males vs. females). Simulated data
are subsequently passed through the standard \code{movedesign} workflow
(model fitting, aggregation, and target-metric evaluation).
}
\details{
When \code{grouped = TRUE}, simulations are generated independently
for each group using group-specific movement parameters, but share
the same sampling parameters. Group structure only affects
downstream inference when \code{which_meta = "ratio"}.
}
\note{
The realism and interpretability of simulated data critically depend
on the choice of movement parameters.
Users are therefore encouraged to inform parameters with empirical
data whenever possible. In the intended workflow, this is done via
\code{\link[=md_prepare]{md_prepare()}}, which derives parameters from fitted movement
models from provided empirical tracking datasets.

Simulations based on hypothetical or weakly justified parameters may
still be useful for exploratory or pedagogical purposes, but require
caution when evaluating sampling designs, estimator performance, or
ecological inference.
