First, navigate (1) 'Select data' tab load dataset available within package. , move (2) 'Sampling design' tab define sampling duration interval. Finally, proceed (3) 'Analyses' tabs. Afterwards, can review detailed summary outputs 'Report' tab. Please choose Select data source choose list available species. , set Home range Speed & distance research targets. analytical target, choose Individual estimate. navigating 'Select data' tab, can choose seven species available ctmm package.

First, select African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer) study species. dropdown menu, select Cilla focal individual click 'Validate' button. choosing individual, must ensure accurately represents movement behavior aim emulate. validation step ensures can detect position autocorrelation timescale (τp\\tau_p), essential home range estimation, velocity autocorrelation timescale (τv\\tau_v), speed & distance estimation. validation successful, button now read 'Validated!' Proceed clicking 'Extract' button.  Next, navigate 'Sampling design' tab. , evaluate intended sampling design future tracking project, simulating data conditioned extracted movement parameters. Step 1. Select tracking device: Choose GPS/Satellite logger tracking device. GPS/Satellite loggers automate sampling using satellite systems. However, sampling duration sampling interval inherently limited GPS battery life. tradeoff determines much data can collected time. Step 2. Adjust battery life fix rate: , can configure two key parameters: GPS battery life, expected operational duration GPS device, Maximum GPS fix rate, longest possible time interval recorded locations (fixes) duration. device manufacturer typically provides information, listed model’s documentation. Now, adjust settings follows: set GPS battery life 2 years, set Maximum GPS fix rate 1 fix every 6 hours. , sampling parameters plot, choose sampling interval 2 hours. Step 3 (optional). Add device limitations: may include device limitations, location error success fix rate, understand precision reliability sampling schedule various conditions. Change Fix success rate (%) 85%, Location error 10 meters. Step 4. Validate run simulation: Click ‘Validate’ button reads ‘Validated!’, click ‘Run’ button. Two notifications appear: first calculation expected run time, second simulation model fitting based current parameters. Wait finish proceeding.  Navigate 'Analyses' tabs. step, use Autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimator (AKDE) (Fleming et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2022), available ctmm R package, estimate home range area. introduction box 'Home range' tab: Step 1. Run estimation: Click Run estimation generate home range estimate. Step 2. Interpret outputs: tab presents three key outputs: Estimate: computed home range size, accompanied 95% confidence interval (low–high) account uncertainty. Relative error (%): percentage deviation estimate CIs true home range. Lower error values indicate precise estimate. Effective sample size (Narea): number home range crossing events, influences reliability estimate. Given current sampling parameters (sampling interval one fix every 2 hours realized duration 10.1 months), Narea ≈ 42, indicating approximately 42 home range crossing events occurred within sampling period. visualization compares estimated home range true home range. Ideally, point estimate closely match true home range. 95% confidence intervals narrow possible tightly follow point estimate. case study, single simulation yielded wide confidence intervals, suggesting high uncertainty suggesting longer sampling duration may necessary. However, relative error low, indicating additional data collection may substantially change point estimates, narrow confidence intervals.  step, using continuous-time speed & distance (CTSD) estimator (Noonan et al., 2019), available ctmm R package. introduction box 'Speed & distance' tab: Step 1. Run estimation: Click Run estimation estimate speed & distance. Step 2. Interpret outputs: output types identical 'Home range' tab. However, case, apply distance (comparing trajectory derived selected sampling schedule true fine-scale trajectory, shown grey), speed. Ideally, closely align truth. Wide confidence intervals indicate high uncertainty, suggesting shorter sampling interval may necessary improve accuracy. Given current sampling parameters (sampling interval one fix every 2 hours realized duration 10.1 months), Nspeed ≈ 1,127. equivalent 1,127 independently sampled velocities. higher Nspeed enhances estimate precision reduces uncertainty.
