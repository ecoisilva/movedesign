# Merge multiple simulation outputs

Merges the results of multiple simulation runs, each produced by
[`md_run()`](https://ecoisilva.github.io/movedesign/reference/md_run.md),
into a single unified `movedesign_output` object. This is especially
useful when running replicate simulations for power analyses,
sensitivity testing, or batch processing. Merging allows you to
aggregate all simulated individuals, outputs, and related metadata,
enabling streamlined downstream analyses.

## Usage

``` r
md_merge(..., ignore_mismatch = FALSE)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  One or more objects of class `movedesign_preprocess`, typically
  generated by
  [`md_run()`](https://ecoisilva.github.io/movedesign/reference/md_run.md).
  Each object must contain, at minimum, the elements `simList`,
  `simfitList`, and `seedList`. Optional elements such as `akdeList` and
  `ctsdList` are merged if present.

- ignore_mismatch:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, the function will attempt to merge inputs even if
  they have mismatched columns. Use with caution.

## Value

A single `movedesign_output` object that contains all merged simulation
outputs and inherits metadata from the first input object. The output
includes:

- Merged list of simulated individuals (`simList`),

- Merged list of fitted models (`simfitList`),

- Merged list of seeds used for each simulation replicate (`seedList`),

- Optionally, merged home range (`akdeList`) and speed (`ctsdList`)
  outputs,

- Relevant metadata describing the study design parameters.

## Examples

``` r
if (interactive()) {
  input <- md_prepare(
    data = buffalo,
    models = models,
    species = "buffalo",
    n_individuals = 5,
    dur = list(value = 1, unit = "month"),
    dti = list(value = 1, unit = "day"),
    add_individual_variation = TRUE,
    grouped = FALSE,
    set_target = "hr",
    which_meta = "mean"
  )

  output1 <- md_run(input)
  output2 <- md_run(input)

  merged <- md_merge(output1, output2)
}
```
